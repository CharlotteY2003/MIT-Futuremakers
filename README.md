7/6 - I'm hoping to learn the fundamentals of AI and apply it to sofware projects focusing on social impact. <br> <br>
7/7 - Our identity isn't individual - we are part of communities. First step to reach our shared goal is crafting a well-thought out narrative (story telling). Need head and heart to execute mindful action successfully (strategy analysis and story motivation). Emotions can affect whether we take our actions (inhibitors or motivators). All good stories have choice, challenge, and outcome. Most have some type of moral or lesson. Story of us (community), self (call to leadership), and now (strategy and action). Pick one or two key choice points that relate to your calling today. Before the leadership session, I thought that my story wasn't worth sharing, but after lisetening to other people's stories and hearing about how well-crafted stories can convey people's stories no matter the persepctive, I realize that everyone's stories need to be heard. <br><br>
7/8 - i.) Supervised learning uses labelled datsets that already have actual results to train the model. Unsupervised learning uses no labelled data during the training process and usually is used to find patterns/relationships among the dataset <br>
ii.) Sklearn does not have the ability to visualize data without additional libraries as sklearn was created for a software engineer's perspecive - focusing on machine learning and data modeling. <br><br>
7/9 - <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability'>Dataset</a> <br>
  I would use convonlutional neural networks to develop a solution to detecting clean water because they can be have the benefits of recurrent or feed-forward, while needing fewer weights. They are also faster to count and less prone to overfitting.  <br><br>
7/12 - Tensors are multidimensional arrays that are a combination of components and basic vectors, making them unique. They are used to encode multidimensional data in machine learning. I noticed that the interactive programs I ran in the TensorFlow programs it was able to handle larger datasets and produce more computations in less time.
